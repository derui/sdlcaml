(** This module provide type of Quaternion and quaternion related operations.

    Provided operations are as follows;
    - identity
    - normalize
    - multiply
    - convert to matrix
    Quaternion type provide from this module is depending on {!Gl_vector} and {!Gl_matrix}.

(** type of quaternion.
    user is only using by this module functions to be intermadiate.
    if need information of quaternion, using `axis' and `angle'
    function of this module.
*)
type t

(** construct identity quaternion.
*)
val identity : unit -> t

(** construct a quaternion from angle of degree and rotation axis.
    if given axis is not unit vector, this function is using without
    change.
    To need unit axis, call `normalize' with target quaternion.
*)
val make : angle:float -> vector:Gl_vector.t -> t

(** return a normalized quaternion.
    normalized quaternion has a unit axis.
*)
val normalize : t -> t

(** multiply first quaternion by second one.
    this function is precise math definition, so if some quaternion
    need to combine, multipling order is `right to left'.
*)
val multiply : t -> t -> t

(** helper to multiply quaternions.
    applying order of each function,
    ( *> ) is `first to second', but ( *< ) is `second to first',
    if equlivalence order of quaternions give.
*)
val ( *> ) : t -> t -> t
val ( *< ) : t -> t -> t

(** extract informations from quaternion type variable. *)
val axis : t -> Gl_vector.t
val angle : t -> float

(** create rotation matrix from given quaternion.
    if this quaternion is not unit, apply `normalize' for previous
    converting.
*)
val to_matrix : t -> Gl_matrix.t

(** construct `obversing quaternion` between from and
    by obversing frequency.
    freq is only applied with between 0.0 and 1.0.
    if out of this range, raise exception.
*)
val slerp : from_quat:t -> to_quat:t -> freq:float -> t
