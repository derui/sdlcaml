(** SDL Utility Kit with Sdlcaml.
    These modules are providing functional and labeled interface for
    using Sdlcaml, for instance, event loop management,
    drawing management, fps management and integrated input management and so on.
    But this do not provide some interface for SDL Subsystems because
    they already has directly binding to SDL, I think SDL interfaces
    are sufficient to use basically and generally.

    Note: functions provided by this module only are used to operate
    for SDL, not OpenGL.

(** event callback managements.

    Event callback managements provided this module is not
    event-driven loop.
    Occurred events by SDL subsystem dispatch each functions in game loop at one time,
    and event loop is not loop in other thread.

    This module can't register function to Quit event, so
    if occur Quit event, end game loop and exit {!game_loop} function.
    To need finalization, you add some code to after {!game_loop}.

    Event callback and game loop are integrated into single thread.

(** type of usable callback functions *)

  | Mouse

(** Use mapping axis of joystick and some key of keyboard.
    Integrated axis and key perform as follows.
    - key pressed when current axis state is greater equal than {!capacity}
    - key released when current axis state is lesser than {!capacity}
    - axis state is full when key pressed
    - axis state is zero when key released

    When joystick axis and keyboard key operate simultaneously,
    choice more big value between them.

    Mapped key and button propagates when pressed either.

    If any funciton haven't registered for given event,
    do nothing.

    @param callback To unregister callback function list

    Nearly to register by {!register_callback_general} equal
    to register by this function.

    Note: callback functions each {!Sdl_event.event} are set
    default function to do nothing.

    @param func callback function for {!Sdl_event.Active}
*)
val active_callback: func:(state:Sdl_event.app_state list -> gain:bool -> unit) -> unit

(** Register function for KeyDown and KeyUp event.
    Details equal {!active_callback}.

    @param func callback function for {!Sdl_event.KeyDown} and {!Sdl_event.KeyUp}
*)
val keyboard_callback: func:(key:Sdl_key.key_info -> state:bool -> unit) -> unit

(** Register function for Mouse button event.
    Details equal {!active_callback}.

(** Register function for Joystick polling event.
    Details equal {!active_callback}.

    Joystick polling occur each when time given {!interval} comes, but
    minimum interval time is greater than time of each game loop.
    If fps set 60, joystick callback function calling interval is at least
    16.67 milliseconds.

    @param func callback function for joystick polling.

    and per-frame operation handling.
    {!display_callback} and {!move_callback} affects this function's performance.

    Given fps by argument effect loop count per second, default is 60fps.
    Argument of {!skip} affect skipping frame when game loop delayed any reason and overtime some
    operations, frame skip enable if true, disable if false.

(** Register the display callback function execute inner game loop.
    Before calling this function, set default function do nothing.

    Note: Registered function by this is not skipped by game loop, so
          registered function have to be called by game loop each frame.

(** Integrate Keyboard and Joystick input infomations.
    Integrated input provide mapping keyboard keystroke to joystick axis and joystick button.

    But, now this don't be able to integrate mouse into keyboard and joystick,
    so mouse input handling is independent from them.

    {!input_info} returned as result from this function is used to with {!input_callback},
    and don't forget to call {!input_close} with it when game loop ended.

    @param id unique number to each integrated input_info.
    @param num the number of joystick.
    @param axis_map the list of mapping joystick axis to some keyboard key. see {!axis_mapping}

    This function must apply all {!input_info} made by {!integrate_inputs}.

    @param info input_info to close

(** Register callback function at end of event handling in game loop.
    Call this function then keyboard and joystick callback function are force changed
    to own callback functions of this.

    If another input_info and callback function registered,
    call them same timing then end of event handling with given {!input_info}

    If given key alreadly binding some buttons, result in equivalent when this function call with
    binding button to given key.
    you have to call {!axis_state} with same {!input_info}.

    Note: To get newest state should call {!force_update} before,
          but these are usually used in callback-function registered by {!add_input_callback}.
